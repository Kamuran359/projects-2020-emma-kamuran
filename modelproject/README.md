# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Solving the consumer problem with model analysis methods**. The first part of the project solves a simple economic model with one consumer and two goods. The consumer has a utility function and an exogenous income. The model is solved both analytically and numerically. The model is then expanded to a pure exchange economy consisting of two consumers who each have their own utility functions and initial endowments of the 2 goods. Finally the edgeworth box is plotted, by calling a function from pyEdgeworthBox.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [Model Project.ipynb].

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires #!pip install pyEdgeworthBox.
