# Inaugural project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).
The project presents a solution to equation 1, which is solved by a loop. It presents two graphs which each show the optimal labour supply and the optimal consumption as functions of the wage rate, which is drawn from a uniform distribution within the range of 0.5 and 1.5. Furthermore the tax reveneu has been calculated for the given parameters, but also for when the elasticity of the labour supply drops.
**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
