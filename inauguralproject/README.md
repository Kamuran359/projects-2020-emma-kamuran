# Inaugural project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).
The project solves a specific consumer maximization problem and solves a maximization problem regarding tax reveneu. 

Two solutions to the consumer problem are presented: solution by a loop and solution by using SciPy. The found optimal labour supply and the optimal consumption are illustrated graphically as functions of the uniformly distributed wage rate. Two different methods for calculating the tax revenue are demonstatred. Finally the optimal parameters that maximize the tax revenue have been found using SciPy.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
